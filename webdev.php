<h3>B2Q Associates.com</h3>
<p>B2Q Associates is a North Andover company specializing in a variety of engineering consulting services. Their licensed engineers, managers and designers provide services such as energy efficiency analysis, Energy Star certification, HVAC system design and building retro-commissioning. We were hired to face-lift their website. They wanted a modern, clean design that was easy to maintain without knowledge of HTML, PHP or other languages. We decided to use wordpress, and built a site that included purchasing stock photography, a featured-item slider for their services, a scrolling client logo list, and contact form.</p>

<h3>Texture Channel.com</h3>
<p>TextureChannel.com is the home page for Texture Technologies series of software and hardware training videos. Our long standing relationship with Texture Technologies lead to a conversation about the most cost-effective and smoothest way to film, publish, and distribute dozens of HD training videos to clients as a subscription service. Not only did we assist in filming, editing, and producing the video work, but we programmed a password protected PHP driven website that is powered by a MySQL database of the available videos, and uses AJAX to dynamically load the content and generate the ordered menu of available content at login.</p>

<h3>Salem State</h3>
<p>During Summer 2010 through Spring 2011 I was hired by the IT department of Salem State University to develop and work on their web team. My focus was to propose designs and improvement to a number of tools used by the faculty and students. I used CSS,  jQuery, and PHP to create mock-up designs, with the goal of emulating the final product. Here are 2 of my designs I proposed to replace their current user portal and internal tools.</p>
